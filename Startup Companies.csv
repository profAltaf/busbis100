More than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.

Ophelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.

Mighty Buildings' technology has the potential to unlock the needed productivity for large scale construction alongside the opportunity for reduced emissions, leading to a more sustainable product and future. Mighty Buildings was founded by a team of physicists and robotics engineers with extensive experience solving hard R&D problems and building successful engineering firms. They started by inventing a new material that is a 3D printing tech that enabled printing of an entire building, not just walls, in a single cycle. Unlike concrete, Mighty Buildingsâ€™ material is lighter, can be uniquely treated (trimmed and cut) by robotic arms, and features high thermal insulation properties. This allows them to produce prefab housing with up to 80% of operations automated.

Mighty Buildings has a near-zero waste production process, preventing 1,100 - 2,000 kg of CO2 emission per 3D-printed home. They are committed to achieving Net-Zero by 2028 - making the company 22 years ahead of the construction industry.

The company is certified under California's Factory Built Housing program to build units using 3D-printing, but they are also the first company to achieve certification under the UL 3401 standard for evaluating building structures and assemblies."

Yet, Chinese factories seem undifferentiated because they all make the same, unverifiable claims of excellence. 

This results in competition centered on price. Factories are forced to under-bid contracts to win business, but often, they later surprise the customer with quality problems and delays.

This process is broken. We install cameras and remote monitoring software on the assembly line, and this ensures compliance with test protocol, improves quality, reduces liability, and helps fight warranty fraud.

We charge a nominal per-unit fee to the OEM and revenue share with the factory when they demonstrate compliance with quality standards (whether units pass or fail).

It encourages better behavior from factories and rewards those who perform with an audit trail of good performance that helps them win new foreign business.

We launched in India 60 days ago and have grown from 0 to 40k transacting users and hit a monthly GTV of $280K already. We are growing 25% week on week.

India is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. 

Gold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.

Using automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. 

With 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity.

This isn't drones for burritos though, unless you want literally tons of burritos! We are addressing heavy payloads - the hardest stuff to fly electrically. 

Whether youâ€™re in Antigua or Australia, Saipan or Sumatra, goods can take days or weeks to come by boat the cheap way. If you need pharmaceuticals, fresh produce, or electronics quickly, expect to pay 10x or 20x in shipping costs to have it flown. Electric aircraft could be a solution for lowering cost, but weâ€™re stuck with small payloads and low range for many years to come. So for the hundreds of millions of people around the world in coastal or inter-island communities that could benefit the most, the electric aviation revolution just isnâ€™t coming. Unless...

Without requiring FAA certification or integration into formal airspace, Seaflightâ€™s simple uncrewed ""ground effect"" craft will enable high value, time-sensitive cargo to be flown overwater, point-to-point between coastal communities at 10x the speed of a ship, with triple the margin of conventional air freight, and almost double the range or payload of a conventional electric aircraft. Express air cargo continues to grow at double digit pace, it's time to deliver it in the most efficient way possible for cost and climate. 

*You wonâ€™t find impossible machines here*

1) We have prototype early flying hardware (at 25% scale) with autopilot for sustained low altitude flight, built and developed entirely in-house.
2) Weâ€™re actively working with the Coast Guard and branches of the armed forces to be able to safely test and develop our systems and operations in controlled ways, to reduce risk - but if the US moves slowly, we have an MoU for unrestricted testing in Europe. 
3) After that weâ€™ll partner with an existing logistics operation to fly initial routes that are not heavily trafficked by ships, to build up our reliability and safety before scaling to other markets.

In recent years, card-issuing as-a-service has become mainstream: any company can now start their own card business in a matter of weeks. Last year, the number of new payment cards issued was at an all-time high. For users, however, switching banks or opening a new card now comes with an additional hurdle: they need to update their payment info across the internet. On the other side of that equation, card issuers have no visibility or control over the card-on-file updating process, and as a result struggle to get their new users to switch their spend from their old card to the new one, leading to low conversion rates and missed revenue opportunities.

Tailor is the first YC company fully based in Japan.

**The Problem**

70% of the Japanese 100 billion software market is spent on customized development!

However, Japan is not alone when it comes to customizing the legacy ERP system in a large enterprise.

Legacy, monolithic systems make it very difficult to customize and hard to integrate. Every time the company wants to change something, it becomes a huge project.

- Clunky and complicated UI
- Too many features that youâ€™ll never use
- Too less features that you actually need
- Poor 3rd party integration options
- No transparency / black box system
- Just super expensive

**The Solution**

Why Headless?

- With our headless product, the frontend is easy to customize for clients
- API-first approach makes it easy to connect with other existing systems or 3rd party services

What does it mean to our clients?

- Faster development
- Reduced maintenance cost
- Well-documented backend APIs

Tailorâ€™s key capabilities:

- GraphQL endpoint for flexible frontend development
- Customizable data model templates to describe complex business logic of large enterprises

771,Cisterna Biologics,http://www.cisternabx.com,High quality mRNA for therapeutic application,2022,1,"San Diego, CA",USA,1,2,5,"Founded in 2022 and based in San Diego, California, Cisterna Biologics is a technology company. It aims to solve the main challenges currently facing the biotech industry to develop mRNA-based therapeutics â€“ quality, quantity, longevity and cost of mRNA. As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic.

Cisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3â€™ end. This assures not only 3â€™ homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3â€™ end. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination. These are just a few examples of Cisternaâ€™s powerful technologies being used to achieve our goal of 10x higher quality mRNA for therapeutic application.

Our overarching goal is to extend our platform technologies to express and purify mRNA directly from a eukaryotic host such as yeast. This would lead to a significant reduction in cost of mRNA manufacturing and potentially an even greater improvement in quality. There is accumulating evidence that naturally occurring mRNAs, with all the native folded structures and endogenous modifications, are better at expressing proteins without triggering innate immune responses compared to synthesized mRNAs - creating a more effective and accessible treatment for patients worldwide."

On average, store owners buy products from over 10-15 different suppliers each week. This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesalerâ€™s sales representatives (who sometimes donâ€™t even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.

Attain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.
